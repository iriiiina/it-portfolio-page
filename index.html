              Irina is a professional software tester in the best sense of the
              word. She is continuously developing and broadening her knowledge
              in testing and technology which makes her an invaluable team
              member and leader in her own right. Irina is willing to take the
              time and make the effort to learn new skills, and pass this
              knowledge on in a team setting or by publishing a blog post. With
              her calm attitude and considerable technical savvy, she's the one
              to work with in building quality software.

              Irina Ivanova was a volunteer in Tartu University Hospital
              Children's Foundation from 2013 to 2014. Irina helped with all
              day-to-day IT related issues in the organization, but her greatest
              project was to create platform and prototype for the new homepage
              according to the visuals provided by creative agency. I am very
              thankful to Irina for all her time, that she was ready to
              contribute in the idea to evolve IT area of one of the largest
              children's oriented foundation in Estonia! If all people would do
              voluntary work with such commitment as Irina did, then charitable
              organizations would evolve as common successful organizations!

              Irina is definitely valuable employee.
