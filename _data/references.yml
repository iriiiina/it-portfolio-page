    Irina Ivanova was a volunteer in Tartu University Hospital Children's Foundation from 2013 to 2014.

    Irina helped with all day-to-day IT related issues in the organization, but her greatest project was to create platform and prototype for the new homepage according to the visuals provided by creative agency.

    I am very thankful to Irina for all her time, that she was ready to contribute in the idea to evolve IT area of one of the largest children's oriented foundation in Estonia!

    If all people would do voluntary work with such commitment as Irina did, then charitable organizations would evolve as common successful organizations!

    Irina is a professional software tester in the best sense of the word. She is continuously developing and broadening her knowledge in testing and technology which makes her an invaluable team member and leader in her own right. Irina is willing to take the time and make the effort to learn new skills, and pass this knowledge on in a team setting or by publishing a blog post. With her calm attitude and considerable technical savvy, she's the one to work with in building quality software.

    Irina is always up to practice new technologies and gadgets or create something on her own in order to improve results and make life easier. Curiosity going hand in hand with ultimate correctness and ability to dig into the depths most testers wouldn't dare to dream of makes her unique.
